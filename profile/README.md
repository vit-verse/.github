### 🧩 Im Lazy Extension (Under Development)
A productivity-focused browser extension aimed at significantly reducing friction and delays in VTOP-related workflows.

**Core features (working & in progress):**
- Auto-login for **VTOP**, **VTOP Registration**, and **LMS**
- Bypass artificial delays in FFCS
- Show slot clashes directly on the FFCS registration page
- Reduce login-to-registration flow from minutes to ~4–5 seconds
- CAPTCHA auto-fill for FFCS and VTOP (where applicable)
- Inject faculty ratings directly into FFCS and VTOP
- Sort faculties based on rating, preference, or relevance
- Highlight preferred faculties, slots, or keywords for faster decisions
- Automatically fetch VTOP academic calendar data and raise PRs to the **VIT Academic Calendar** repository used by the VIT Verse app

This extension is actively evolving with more automation and productivity features planned.
